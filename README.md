## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implementation to classify images of dogs and cats 🐶🐱. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) 🏆.

🔹 **Dataset**: Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" Dataset  
🔹 **Model**: CNN (Deep Learning) using Keras & TensorFlow  
🔹 **Platform**: Google Colab 🚀  
🔹 **Goal**: Achieve high accuracy in classifying dog and cat images  
🔹 **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🧠 Model Architecture

📌 **Input Layer** - Image size (e.g., 150x150x3)  
📌 **Convolutional Layers** - Feature extraction using multiple Conv2D layers  
📌 **Pooling Layers** - Downsampling using MaxPooling2D  
📌 **Fully Connected Layers** - Dense layers for classification  
📌 **Output Layer** - Softmax activation for final classification  

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150,150,3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
```
